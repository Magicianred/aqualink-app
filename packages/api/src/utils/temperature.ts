/** 
 * Corals start to become stressed when the SST is 1°C warmer than the maxiumum monthly mean temperature (MMM).
 * The MMM is the highest temperature out of the monthly mean temperatures over the year (warmest summer month)
 * 1°C above the MMM is called the "bleaching threshhold"
 * When the SST is warmer than the bleaching threshold temperature, the corals will experience heat stress. This heat stress is the main cause of mass coral bleaching.
 * The HotSpot highlights the areas where the SST is above the MMM.
 * The DHW shows how much heat stress has accumulated in an area over the past 12 weeks (3 months). The units for DHW are "degree C-weeks"
 * The DHW adds up the Coral Bleaching HotSpot values whenever the temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold.
 * Bleaching Alerts:
 *      No Stress (no heat stress or bleaching is present): HotSpot of less than or equal to 0. 
 *      Bleaching Watch (low-level heat stress is present): HotSpot greater than 0 but less than 1; SST below bleaching threshhold. 
 *      Bleaching Warning (heat stress is accumulating, possible coral bleaching): HotSpot of 1 or greater; SST above bleaching threshold; DHW greater than 0 but less than 4. 
 *      Bleaching Alert Level 1 (significant bleaching likely): HotSpot of 1 or greater; SST above bleaching threshold; DHW greater than or equal to 4 but less than 8. 
 *      Bleaching Alert Level 2 (severe bleaching and significant mortality likely): HotSpot of 1 or greater; SST above bleaching threshold; DHW greater than or equal to 8. 
 * 
 * DHW = (1/7)*sum[1->84](HS(i) if HS(i) >= 1C)
